All work was done by myself, and I didn't copy any code from the internet. If my code shares similarity with something found online, it probably just means the method is too common.

For number 1, the answer is in the .txt file, but GitHub doesn't display linewrapping. 
For number 2-4, the input and output files are in the same directory as the .py file.
For number 5, I created my own program loop in order to get delta time.
